\section{Introduction} \label{chap:introduction}

Smart contracts brought forth a new era of decentralized finance, with increasing value being funneled into DEFI platforms.
In turn, they have become attractive tools for scammers and protocol attackers to steal digital assets.

As there is growing scrutiny by both users and security tools, malicious actors are answering with deception.
To achieve their end goals, they first have to appear legitimate and circumvent the security tools.
This involves specific tricks, which we refer to as "evasion" and are the focus of this document.

Exploit detection mechanisms and evasive tactics have played a relentless cat-and-mouse game in the binary and web spaces.
Now, this history can be analyzed to improve the current detection tools and anticipate future threats in the web3 ecosystem.
We will delve into the code of each evasion technique, highlight their distinctive features and propose countermeasures.
