## TODO

- requires to fetch contract bytecode: slower agent?
- online fuzzing & symbolic parsing?
- bot context:
  - how to request source code?
  - how to fetch transaction history?
- implement indicators as a lib?
  - when the input data (contract source code) is not accessible for the bot?
- YARA style reference implementations / signatures?
- from Web2:
  - living off the land (memory / network)
  - injections (infecting common files)
- report a hack / scam:
  - https://www.chainabuse.com/report
- how does detection impact scammers?
  - (morphing / lateral mvt necessary?)
- alternative taxonomy:
  - evading users (faking contracts)
  - evading reviewers (code volume, subtle exploits etc)
  - evaing tests (tx simulation)
  - evading tools (etherscan code review, forta, etc)
- tx simulation:
  - `block.basefee`
  - `tx.gasprice`
- a mix of "normal" behaviors can be malicious: it's the mix that matters
  - normal token + normal proxy in a single contract is suspicious
  - identify each class of contracts independently
  - if a contract is seen as 90% token and 90% proxy it is abnormal
- NORMAL behavior is key:
  - what is normal FOR a type of contract
  - sthg normal to a proxy is suspicious on a token
- smartbugs: which is relevant?
- level of detail for the detection:
  - principle?
  - code snippet
- too many RPC requests??
- how to write antivirus?
  - combine metrics?
  - language to describe complex combination of indicators?
