\subsection{Bytecode}

Similarly to the traditional binaries, smart contracts are compiled into bytecode which can be parsed: headers

\subsection{Opcode Sequence}

Bytecode can be interpreted as a language, giving a level of abstraction to the analysis.

\subsection{Function Signatures}

More specifically, functions can be extracted and compared to the reference implementations of the standards for example

\subsection{Source code}

When available, this layer can hold deceptive measures for the human reader; hence, it is very informative + creation code (not in bytecode)
