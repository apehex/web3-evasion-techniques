\section{Hybrid Analysis} \label{sec:data-hybrid}

Zooming out from the perspective of a single smart contract, the blockchain can be considered as a whole.
This is a mix of the static data over all addresses and the dynamic data generated over time and addresses.

Rather than going over all the data sources again, this section offers new angles from which they can be considered.

\subsection{Statistics}

The activity of a single address over time can be broken-down with statistics

Cash flow.

\subsubsection{Creation time}

The age of the contract can be learnt from \lstinline[language=Solidity]{block.timestamp} and \lstinline[language=Solidity]{block.number}.

It can be used to weight other temporal data

\subsection{Graph Theory} \label{sec:hybrid-graph}

The blockchain archive can be seen as a temporal graph.
While the exact structure can vary depending on the application, generally the nodes are the addresses and the vertices are transactions.

\subsection{Machine learning}

\subsection{Symbolic Fuzzing}

Tools like \href{\urlcodehoneybadger}{HoneyBadger} leverage symbolic testing to explore all the execution paths.
