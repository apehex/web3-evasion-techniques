\section{Hybrid Analysis} \label{sec:data-hybrid}

Zooming out from the perspective of a single smart contract, the blockchain can be considered as a whole.
This is a mix of the static data over all addresses and the dynamic data generated over time and addresses.

\subsection{Statistics} \label{sec:hybrid-stats}

The activity of a single address over time can be broken-down with statistics

Cash flow.

\subsection{Graph Theory} \label{sec:hybrid-graph}

The blockchain archive can be seen as a temporal graph.
While the exact structure can vary depending on the application, generally the nodes are the addresses and the vertices are transactions.
