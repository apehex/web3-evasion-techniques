\section{Static Analysis} \label{sec:data-static}

Outside of execution, the blockchain acts as a cold storage.
In this first context, the detection methods are called "static analysis".

\subsection{Block \& Transaction Metadata}

\subsubsection{Contract's creator}

\subsubsection{Transaction Metadata}

Details like the contract's creator, the balance, the creation timestamp and associated Ether provide a context to the whole analysis

\subsection{Code} \label{sec:static-code}

\subsubsection{Bytecode}

Similarly to the traditional binaries, smart contracts are compiled into bytecode which can be parsed: headers

\subsubsection{Opcode Sequence}

Bytecode can be interpreted as a language, giving a level of abstraction to the analysis.

\subsubsection{Function Signatures}

More specifically, functions can be extracted and compared to the reference implementations of the standards for example

\subsubsection{Source code}

When available, this layer can hold deceptive measures for the human reader; hence, it is very informative + creation code (not in bytecode)
