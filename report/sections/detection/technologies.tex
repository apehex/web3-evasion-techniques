\subsection{Signature Based}

Signature-based malware detection extracts distinctive information known as signatures to detect malware.
then compared against references to determine whether the unclassified binaryâ€™s signature indicates malicious behavior.

\subsubsection{YARA}

YARA separates the detection logic from the software that scans files.
It has a rule-based language extending the regular expressions.
It was originally designed for traditional binaries, but the YARA rules could be applied to smart contract bytecode or even source code.

\subsubsection{Semgrep}

Similarly, \href{https://semgrep.dev/r?&lang=Solidity}{Semgrep patterns} can help prototype detection ideas.

\subsubsection{Solidity Static Analysis Tools}

Tools like Mythril, Slither, and Securify can analyze Solidity smart contract code for known vulnerabilities.
While they primarily focus on vulnerabilities rather than malware, their methodologies could inspire a signature-based approach to detect malicious intent in smart contracts.
