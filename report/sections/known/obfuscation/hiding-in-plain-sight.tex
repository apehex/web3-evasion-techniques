\section{Hiding In Plain Sight}

\subsection{Evades}

Here, the goal is to overwhelm source code reviewers with the sheer volume of code.

It also lowers the efficiency of ML algorithms.

\subsection{How}

By stacking dependencies, the scammer grows the volume of the source code to thousands of lines.

99\% of the code is classic, legitimate implementation of standards.

And the remaining percent is malicious code, hidden inside one of the numerous dependencies for example.

\subsection{Samples}

Hidden among 7k+ lines of code:

\begin{lstlisting}
// no authorization modifier `onlyOwner`
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual {
    if (newOwner == address(0)) {
        revert OwnableInvalidOwner(address(0));
    }
    _transferOwnership(newOwner);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Detection \& Countermeasures}

1. The proportion of unused code can be leveraged from the transaction history.
