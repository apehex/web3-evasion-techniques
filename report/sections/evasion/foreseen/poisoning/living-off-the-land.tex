\section{Living Off The Land} \label{sec:living-off-the-land}

\subsection{Overview}

Living off the land means surviving on what you can forage, hunt, or grow in nature.
For malware, it means using generic, OS-level, tools to compromise a target.

For smart contracts, it could mean:

\begin{itemize}
\item{taking advantage of callbacks to run malicious code}
\item{using factory contracts to deploy evil variants}
\end{itemize}

The more complex the protocol, the more facilities they will offer for attackers.

\subsection{Evasion Targets}

Potentially, this category of evasion could bypass many layers of defense:
since a significant part of the exploitation runs in legitimate contracts, their authority will most likely escape detection.
