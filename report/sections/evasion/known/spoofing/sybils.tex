\subsection{Overview}

Much like social networks, the blockchain is made of interconnected users.
Their activity in and out of the blockchain gives weight to a project.

So scammers could:

\begin{itemize}
\item{creates bots and enroll people to build a legitimate history on their contracts}
\item{create a normal service to hijack it later}
\end{itemize}

Bots have been leveraged to generate trading activity for several tokens: DZOO, oSHIB, oDOGE, GPT, and SHIBP at least.
For instance, the \href{\urlarticlesoftrugpull}{case study of the DZOO campaign} shows how it used bot EOAs to pump the price of its token.

These techniques are an \href{\urlarticlesybilattack}{active area of research} and would require an entire study.
They will not be covered in this document.
